Python Program to Analyze Speech Language.

This is a program I wrote for a computer science class. It takes in 3 different speech names (for the purposes of the assignment, the names are hardcoded) and relevant information on the text is returned.

Program outputs # of characters in speech, # of sentences, # of words, # of unique words, % of words that are unique, the longest word, and the most used words over 5 letters. 

Main reason for the creation of this program was to analyze politican speeches for manipulative language. By analyzing their speeches, further development into language processing can made.
